# Executive Summary — E-Commerce Business Analysis

## Objective
Evaluate revenue growth, product performance, customer behavior, and delivery operations to assess business sustainability.

## Key Findings
- Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased order volume rather than higher average order value.
- A small number of product categories generated a disproportionate share of revenue.
- Some high-volume categories exhibited low average order value, posing potential margin risks.
- Repeat buyers contributed more total revenue than one-time buyers despite being fewer in number.
- Delivery delays were noticeable and may negatively impact customer retention.

## Recommendations
- Invest in customer retention strategies to increase lifetime value.
- Promote premium product categories and bundled offerings to improve margins.
- Reduce reliance on blanket discounts in high-volume, low-AOV categories.
- Improve logistics and delivery reliability to support repeat purchases.
