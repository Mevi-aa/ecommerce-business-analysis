# Day 5 Insights — Product Category Performance

- Revenue is concentrated in a small number of product categories.
- The category `relogios_presentes` showed both high revenue and high average order value, indicating strong profitability.
- The category `cama_mesa_banho` generated high revenue primarily through high order volume but had relatively low average order value.
- High-volume, low-AOV categories may increase operational costs without proportional revenue gains.
- Introducing premium variants or reducing discount dependency in these categories could improve margins.
